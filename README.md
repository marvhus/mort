# MORT 
A programming language 

## Inspiration
This language has been inspired by some other languages like jai, and odin.

## Implementation
This language is a work in progress,  
but so far it is made in C++.  
It uses a custom made lexer,  
and will in the future use LLVM to compile to native code.

- Q:  Where did it all begin?  
- A:  This all began by me starting to watch a series Tsoding made on making porth, and I followed along, but then I found out about jai, and odin, and after watching a bunch of Jon's videos, I wanted to try making my own... and so I did. I started off in Rust, but quickly switched over to C++ for more control.
